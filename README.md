How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I built this using two arrays--one for the present list and one for the tardy list. I pushed the value from the user input to a certain list. With a button click, it will append to specified list. To show and hide the list, I used the toggle method. 

Optimizations


If I had more time, I would make the interface more appealing. I would add a edit section, a date/time section as well. 
I would also save the results in a variable. 

Lessons Learned:
I was introduced to pushing and pulling items into arrays.
